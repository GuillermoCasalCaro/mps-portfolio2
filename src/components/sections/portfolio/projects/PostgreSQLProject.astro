  <h2>PostgreSQL Reports Automation â€” Chinook DB</h2>
  <Paragraph content={'I worked with the classic ##Chinook## music store database, hosted on ##Supabase## using ##PostgreSQL 17##. The goal was to generate useful reports from SQL queries and automate their delivery.'} />

  <Paragraph content={'All SQL scripts were stored in a dedicated folder and executed automatically using ##GitHub Actions##. The workflow connects to the remote database securely through the ##connection pooler## and runs the queries as part of a CI pipeline.'} />
  <img src="/projects/sql-workflow.png" alt="GitHub Actions Workflow for SQL" />
  <Paragraph content={'Each script output is saved as a ##CSV## file and published to ##GitHub Pages##, making the reports publicly accessible. This setup allows for easy inspection of data like album sales, top customers, and invoice histories.'} />
