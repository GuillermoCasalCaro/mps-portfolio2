  <h2>Full API Testing Automation of Trello API</h2>
  <p>
    I built a full API test automation workflow for the <strong>Trello API</strong>. My main focus
    was to make sure all requests, responses, and error cases were covered using a clean and
    organized <strong>Postman</strong> collection with tests.

    I started testing everything locally with a <strong>Jenkins</strong> container from
    <strong>Docker</strong> to get a local CI setup going.

  <p>
    Later on, I switched to <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> because it was easier to integrate and let
    me publish and host the reports publicly.

  <p>
    With <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>, I also set up automatic deployments and used the
    <em>htmlextra</em>reporter for <strong>Newman</strong> to generate rich HTML reports. These reports
    made it super easy to review test results visually. The whole pipeline is all about being reliable,
    easy to maintain, and giving clear feedback with every run.
