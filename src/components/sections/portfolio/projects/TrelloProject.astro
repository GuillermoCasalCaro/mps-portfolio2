    Full API Testing Automation of Trello API
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    This project involved designing and implementing a comprehensive API test
    automation workflow for the public Trello API. The core focus was to ensure
    that all request and response behaviors, as well as error handling
    scenarios, were thoroughly validated through well-structured Postman
    collections.

  <p class="mb-4">
    To automate the test executions, we used <strong>Newman</strong>, the CLI
    companion for Postman, enabling integration with continuous integration
    pipelines. This was complemented by <strong>Jenkins</strong>, which
    orchestrated the CI/CD workflows to provide fast and reliable feedback on
    every code change.

  <p class="mb-4 text-default">
    Additionally, <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> was leveraged for automating deployments
    and publishing detailed HTML reports generated with the <em>htmlextra</em> Newman
    reporter. These reports summarize test results with an intuitive UI, making it
    easier for the team to analyze failures and successes.

    The project also incorporated a lightweight app integrating real-time data
    from a public weather API to demonstrate dynamic API interactions beyond
    Trello's endpoints. The entire pipeline emphasizes reliability,
    maintainability, and clear traceability of test outcomes.
