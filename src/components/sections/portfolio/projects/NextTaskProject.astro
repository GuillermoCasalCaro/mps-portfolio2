  <h2>Test Plan & Bug Reporting â€” NextTask App</h2>
  <p>
    During one sprint, I collaborated on a forked version of the open-source app
    <a href="https://solara-next-task.netlify.app/" target="_blank" class="text-link underline">
      NextTask
    </a>. A teammate handled the development, while I focused on writing a detailed
    <strong>test plan</strong> covering several key <strong>features</strong> and
    <strong>user stories</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used <strong>Xray</strong> and <strong>Jira</strong> to manage test cases and bug reports, with
    full documentation structured in <strong>Confluence</strong>. The testing focused on core CRUD
    operations and ensuring traceability from requirements to test coverage.
  </p>

    You can view the original app on the previous link or download the test documentation as a PDF
    on the button below.
